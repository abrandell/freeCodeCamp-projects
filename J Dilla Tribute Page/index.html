                        underground hip hop scene in Detroit, Michigan as one third of the acclaimed music group Slum Village. His obituary at NPR stated that he "was one of the music industry's most influential hip-hop artists", working with notable
                        acts including A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Busta Rhymes, Erykah Badu, The Roots, The Pharcyde and Common.</p>

                    <p>In 2006 James Yancey passed away. The seriousness of his condition became public in November 2005 when J Dilla toured Europe performing from a wheelchair. It was later revealed that he suffered from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
                        and possibly lupus.</p>

                    <p>J Dilla was survived by two daughters.In May 2006, J Dilla's mother announced the creation of the J Dilla Foundation, which will work to cure people affected by lupus. Dilla's death has had a significant impact on the hip-hop community.
                        Besides countless tribute tracks and concerts, Dilla's death created a wealth of interest in his remaining catalog and, consequently, Dilla's influence on hip-hop production became more apparent.</p>
